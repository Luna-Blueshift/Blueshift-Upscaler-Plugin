# Blueshift Image Quality Plugin
Suite of Unreal Engine 5 plugins designed to make it easier to interface with image quality in Unreal Engine 5, with a focus on user-facing settings. This plugin also streamlines interoperability with upscalers like DLSS, FSR, XeSS etc, and anti-aliasing methods.

Provides Game User Settings support, and optional [Blueshift Game Settings plugin](https://github.com/Luna-Blueshift/BlueshiftGameSettings) support to speed up implementation.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Luna-Blueshift/Blueshift-Image-Quality-Plugin/wiki) for documentation.

⚠️ You must supply third party plugins yourself (i.e. DLSS, FSR3/FSR4, XeSS) and compile the plugin from source.
