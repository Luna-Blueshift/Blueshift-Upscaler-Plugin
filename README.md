# Blueshift Upscaler Plugin
Suite of Unreal Engine 5 plugins designed to streamline interoperability with upscalers like DLSS, FSR, XeSS etc.

Provides Game User Settings support, and optional [Blueshift Game Settings plugin](https://github.com/Luna-Blueshift/BlueshiftGameSettings) support to speed up implementation.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Luna-Blueshift/Blueshift-Upscaler-Plugin/wiki) for documentation.

⚠️ Does not come packaged with DLSS, FSR3/FSR4, or XeSS. Those third party plugins you must integrate yourself. This plugin will only interop with them by checking if the plugins exist at compile & runtime.

⚠️ You must compile this plugin yourself as it needs to compile against supported third party plugin libraries.
